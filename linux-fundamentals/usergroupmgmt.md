## Users and Groups
- Users can be normal users or system users (id < 1000): These are like service accounts
- When a user creates a file, the user automatically become the owner of the file and a private grouo with the same name as the user with only that user in it is assigned to the file
- `id` will show identification info of the current user
- Create a user: `sudo useradd <username> [-m]`: -m option also creates a home directory in Ubuntu. In other distros it i created by default
- Remove a user `sudo userdel <username>`
- Create a group: `sudo groupadd <groupname>`
- Add a user to a group: `sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>`
- Users and their properties are stored in /etc/passwd. Common properties:
      - UID: User id
      - GID: the id of the primary group
      - GECOS
      - Home directory
      - Shell: the default shell
 - Use `getent passwd <username>` to get the details of the current user
 - Passwords are stored in `/etc/shadow`
 - Use `vipw` to edit /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd directly
 - Groups are stored in `/etc/group`
 - use `vigr` to edit /etc/group
 - `/etc/login.defs` contains the default configurations for new users
 - `/etc/skell` contains the defaulr content to be copied over to new users home directory
 - Users can change password using `passwd`
